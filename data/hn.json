Stanza is a new optionally-typed general purpose programming language from the University of California, Berkeley. It was designed to help programmers tackle the complexity of architecting large programs and significantly increase the productivity of application programmers across the entire software development life cycle. You can check out the website here:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lbstanza.org<p>Here are three really cool things about Stanza:<p>1. It is <i>both<\/i> statically and dynamically typed. If you give no type annotations, Stanza behaves like a scripting language. The more type annotations you give, the more errors Stanza will catch upfront.<p>2. It has a <i>class-less<\/i> object system. We believe in both object oriented programming and functional programming, and designed Stanza&#x27;s object system to seamlessly incorporate both styles.<p>3. It has a really powerful coroutine system called targetable coroutines. It&#x27;s a <i>general<\/i> control flow construct that can be used for fine control over concurrency, and is useful for things like video games and webservers.<p>We&#x27;ve already been using Stanza internally for about two years now. Using Stanza, we&#x27;ve designed a hardware language called FIRRTL, designed a teaching language called Feeny for teaching a graduate course on virtual machines, wrote a tool for automatically generating circuit boards for robotics, and (as upstanding computer scientists) wrote the entire Stanza compiler in Stanza itself.<p>Now, Stanza is stable and mature enough for us to feel confident to share it with everyone. We hope you&#x27;ll check it out!<p><pre><code>   - The Stanza Team<\/code><\/pre>","11713533":null,"11722711":null,"11715096":null,"11716942":null,"11721027":null,"11715215":null,"11719616":null,"11708873":null,"11707470":"Hey HN,<p>A recent Amazon Echo question got a lot of attention here.
